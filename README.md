Simple job scheduling system for python scripts. Nothing real fancy, just enough to get the job done and not have to mess with cron jobs or something and have a GUI for status and such.

- Lets you upload a script to run, and specify when to run it, and if it repeats or not.  
- Allows user to 'own' the script and they can login to see current status and previous runs and view console outputs. Only admins can schedule / run for security reasons.
- On errors, it will email the owners. 
- Be sure to edit the .env file for your smtp server settings and choose a better default admin password.
- Use SQLite for the back-end DB.
- Schedule Options
    - One time
    - Hourly
    - Daily
    - Weekly
    - Weekdays
    - Monthly
    - Every 4 months ( to accomdate quarterly )
    - Yearly
